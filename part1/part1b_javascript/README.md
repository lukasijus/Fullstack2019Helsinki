#Javascript materials


There exists both good and poor guides for Javascript on the internet. Most of the links on this page relating to Javascript features reference Mozilla's Javascript Guide.

It is highly recommended to immediately read A re-introduction to JavaScript (JS tutorial) on Mozillas website.

If you wish to get to know Javascript deeply there is a great free book series on the internet called You-Dont-Know-JS.
